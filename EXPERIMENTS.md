# Experimental Framework (Conceptual)

This document outlines a **conceptual and observational framework** for discussing
potential experimental validations of the Cellular Aging Congruity 7.0 theory.

No experimental protocols, biological procedures, computational pipelines,
algorithms, thresholds, or predictive implementations are provided or implied.

This file exists to clarify **how results could be interpreted**, not how experiments
should be executed.

---

## 1. Nature of Validation

Validation within the Congruity 7.0 framework is intended to be:

- Observational, not interventional  
- Comparative, not predictive  
- System-level, not mechanism-specific  

The objective is to assess whether **loss of proportionality across domains**
correlates with aging-related decline more consistently than single-domain markers.

---

## 2. Domains of Observation

The framework considers aging as divergence across multiple interacting domains:

- **Energy (E):** metabolic efficiency, ATP-related indicators, mitochondrial performance  
- **Information (I):** genomic and epigenomic integrity, transcriptional noise  
- **Structure (S):** cytoskeletal stability, membrane integrity, nuclear architecture  
- **Functional Value (V):** adaptive, replicative, and repair capacity (conceptual)

Validation focuses on **relative alignment or divergence** between these domains,
not on absolute values of individual biomarkers.

## 3. Comparative Evaluation Logic

Potential observational comparisons may include:

- Young vs. aged cells or tissues  
- Healthy aging vs. pathological aging  
- Caloric restriction or partial reprogramming contexts vs. controls  

The framework emphasizes:
- Cross-domain coherence  
- Emergence of imbalance thresholds  
- Systemic rather than linear decline patterns  

No decision rules or cutoff values are defined.

## 4. Interpretation of Signals

Within this theory:

- Aging acceleration is interpreted as **increasing incoherence**
- Temporary rejuvenation effects are interpreted as **partial realignment**
- Failure of long-term reversal is interpreted as **structural bottlenecks**, not molecular absence

These interpretations remain theoretical and are not intended for clinical inference.

---

## 5. Reproducibility and Independence

All discussions assume:
- Use of publicly available datasets
- Independent replication by third parties
- Absence of proprietary tools or closed methodologies

The framework is intentionally compatible with multiple experimental paradigms
without being tied to any of them.

---

## 6. Explicit Exclusions

This document does NOT include:

- Experimental protocols  
- Wet-lab procedures  
- Algorithms or formulas  
- Computational models  
- Predictive or diagnostic claims  

Any implementation belongs to protected and non-public layers of the framework.

---

## 7. Scientific Intent

The intent of this file is to:
- Enable scientific discussion  
- Support conceptual falsifiability  
- Prevent misinterpretation of the framework as a protocol or therapy  

Congruity 7.0 is presented as a **systemic explanatory lens**, not as a treatment.

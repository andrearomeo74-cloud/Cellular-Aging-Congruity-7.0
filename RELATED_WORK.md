This section situates the Cellular Aging Congruity 7.0 framework within
the broader landscape of aging research.

The intent is **conceptual comparison**, not methodological replacement.

## Classical Aging Theories

Traditional theories of aging focus on specific mechanisms, including:
- Damage accumulation
- Free radical and oxidative stress theories
- Telomere attrition
- Epigenetic drift
- Mitochondrial dysfunction
- Loss of proteostasis

These models successfully describe **local biological processes**, but
generally do not explain:
- Cross-domain synchronization of decline
- Threshold-like transitions into senescence
- Partial reversibility observed in some interventions

---

## Epigenetic Clocks and Biomarkers

Epigenetic clocks provide highly accurate **chronological and biological
age estimates**, based on DNA methylation patterns.

However:
- They operate primarily within a single informational domain
- They do not explicitly model energetic or structural costs
- They describe aging *correlates*, not aging *structure*

Congruity 7.0 is complementary to these approaches.

## Systems Biology and Network Aging

Systems biology approaches model aging as:
- Network degradation
- Loss of robustness
- Increased noise and entropy

These perspectives align strongly with the Congruity framework, but often
remain **domain-specific** or computationally implementation-dependent.

Congruity 7.0 remains implementation-agnostic by design.

## Rejuvenation and Partial Reset Observations

Experimental results in:
- Partial epigenetic reprogramming
- Caloric restriction
- Autophagy modulation
- Mitochondrial efficiency interventions

suggest that aging is **not strictly irreversible**.

Congruity 7.0 interprets these effects as **temporary or partial
realignments**, constrained by deeper structural bottlenecks.

## Distinct Contribution of Congruity 7.0

The Congruity framework differs by:
- Framing aging as **loss of proportionality**
- Integrating energy, information, structure, and function
- Explaining why local improvements may not scale system-wide
- Remaining neutral with respect to biological implementation

It acts as a **unifying interpretive layer**, not a competing biological model.

---

## Positioning Statement

Congruity 7.0 does not replace existing aging theories.
It provides a **system-level explanatory structure**
capable of integrating them coherently.

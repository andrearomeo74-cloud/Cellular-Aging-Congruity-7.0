# Conceptual Figures

This document describes **conceptual figures** associated with the
Cellular Aging Congruity 7.0 framework.

All figures are **illustrative and explanatory only**.
They do not contain equations, thresholds, algorithms, or implementation logic.

## Figure 1 – Aging as Loss of Proportionality

**Description:**
A schematic representation of cellular aging as a progressive loss of
proportional alignment between Energy, Information, Structure, and Functional Value.

**Key idea:**
Aging is not driven by a single factor, but by increasing divergence
between system domains that were previously coordinated.

---

## Figure 2 – Multidomain Coherence vs Incoherence

**Description:**
Two contrasting states:
- A coherent system (aligned domains)
- An incoherent system (diverging domains)

**Key idea:**
Functional decline emerges when cross-domain proportionality
drops below a systemic coherence threshold (conceptual, not defined).

---

## Figure 3 – Partial Realignment vs Structural Bottleneck

**Description:**
Conceptual comparison between:
- Temporary realignment (e.g., partial rejuvenation signals)
- Persistent structural bottlenecks that prevent long-term reversal

**Key idea:**
Short-term improvements do not imply global system restoration.

---

## Figure 4 – Aging Trajectory as Systemic Drift

**Description:**
Non-linear trajectory of aging illustrated as drift away from proportional balance,
rather than linear damage accumulation.

**Key idea:**
The model explains acceleration phases, plateaus, and partial reversibility.

---

## Figure 5 – Comparison with Single-Domain Aging Models

**Description:**
Conceptual contrast between:
- Traditional single-axis aging explanations
- Multidomain proportionality-based interpretation

**Key idea:**
Congruity 7.0 integrates existing mechanisms without replacing them.

## Usage Notes

These figures are intended for:
- Scientific presentations
- Conceptual discussions
- Educational material
- Comparative theoretical analysis

They are not suitable for clinical, diagnostic, or therapeutic use.
